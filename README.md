# employee-tracker

## Description
This repository contains a JavaScript file as well as a SQL database, and uses Inquirer, Node.js, and the MySQL2 package. They work together to create a command line employee tracker. This tracker is a database that contains information on different departments, roles, and employees. The application is first invoked by the user by running node server.js in the command-line, the user then follows a series of prompts created using the Inquirer package. Within these prompts the user can decide if they want to view information about their employees, the roles, or departments, and they can add or update this information. This application is perfect for any business looking to track information about their business in a database.
